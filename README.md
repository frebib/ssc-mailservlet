#MailServlet is a basic email sending app
It's a email sending application written in Java with Servlets and JSP to send emails from a webserver, prettified by [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
To run and test it I'm running a Tomcat 8 server but I'm sure with a bit of jiggery-pokery it can run on most Java-based servers.

It was built soley for a coursework piece at University of Birmingham, Computer Science Year 2, for the module Software System Components.
